# tic-tac-toe-game

As we all know this game is often played in classrooms on the last page of the notebook 😀.
Two players mark the position in which they want to keep their token alternatively in a 3 ✖️ 3 grid.
Here, player 1 is given the token ❌ and player 2 is given token ⭕️.
The positions are marked as below and the players need to choose any number from these.

   |   |   
 1 | 2 | 3 
___|___|___
   |   |   
 4 | 5 | 6 
___|___|___
   |   |   
 7 | 8 | 9 
   |   |   

After choosing the corresponding position will be marked with the corresponding tokens.
Game will end if any row or column or diagonal of the saem token is found.
